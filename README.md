# Adding your language

Fork this repository, and make a copy of the ```en.lproj``` folder located in at the root of this repository. Rename this copy to the corresponding language code, for example (French = fr.lproj). DO NOT change the original ```en.lproj``` folder, make a copy! A list of language codes can be found [here](https://www.ibabbleon.com/iOS-Language-Codes-ISO-639.html). For each ```.strings``` file, CHANGE ONLY THE LOWERCASE STRING! An example being this translated French string: ```"SETTINGS" = "Settings";``` becoming ```"SETTINGS" = "RÃ©glages";``` To finish, create a pull request, and updated strings will be added. Please [contact me](https://twitter.com/MTAC8) with any localization questions.
