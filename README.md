# Lynx 2 Localizations
Repository containing all Lynx 2 localizations

# Adding a translation

Download each .strings file from the [strings](/strings) folder. Replace the lowercase string with your translation of the text in capital letters. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/MTACS/LynxLocalizations/issues/new?assignees=MTACS&labels=&projects=&template=language-addition.md&title=%5BTRANSLATION%5D) and attach each translated strings file.

_Please do not fork and create pull requests for this repository, use issues instead. It is much easier to maintain and keep translations up to date_

### Examples

***French***
```Settings.strings```

```"SETTINGS" = "Réglages"```

***Arabic***
```Music.strings```

```"MUSIC" = "الموسيقى"```

***Chinese (Simplified)***
```SpringBoard.strings```

```"SPRINGBOARD" = "系统桌面"```

# Updates

Localizations will distributed as a separate package to help with latency between new features and untranslated strings. Please get all localization updates for Lynx from [here](https://mtac.app/repo)
